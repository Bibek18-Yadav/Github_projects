These are the projects which i have done without the use of concept of API key and without adding GUI featurtes . These are simply based on the knowledge of python language and its some of the libraries.
I have made these projects to build my basics in programming field, so that in coming features I can deal with complex and real world/life projects.
I am working on GUI projects and AI powerded projects which will be uploaded soon in next repositories. 
I have mentioned ABOUT.txt file for each projects, so that anyone can know about the project and methods to use it
