CHEMICAL BONDING AND SHAPE OF MOLECULES â€“ Grade 11 Chemistry (Nepal Curriculum)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Chemical bonding is the force that holds atoms together in a molecule or compound. It explains the structure, properties, and reactivity of substances. The shape of molecules affects physical and chemical properties.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. TYPES OF CHEMICAL BONDS
- Ionic Bond:
  Formed by transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal.
  Example: NaCl
- Covalent Bond:
  Formed by sharing of electron pairs between atoms.
  Example: H2O, O2
- Coordinate (Dative) Bond:
  Covalent bond in which both electrons are donated by one atom.
  Example: NH4+
- Metallic Bond:
  Attraction between positive metal ions and delocalized electrons.
  Example: Na, Cu

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. ELECTRONEGATIVITY AND BOND POLARITY
- Electronegativity: Ability of an atom to attract shared electrons.
- Polar Covalent Bond: Unequal sharing of electrons due to difference in electronegativity.
- Nonpolar Covalent Bond: Equal sharing of electrons.
- Dipole Moment: Measure of bond polarity; vector quantity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. BOND PARAMETERS
- Bond Length: Distance between nuclei of two bonded atoms.
- Bond Angle: Angle between two bonds originating from the same atom.
- Bond Energy: Energy required to break a bond; indicates bond strength.
- Bond Order: Number of shared electron pairs between two atoms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. VSEPR THEORY (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion)
- Predicts the shape of molecules based on repulsion between electron pairs.
- Common Shapes:
  - Linear: AB2 (e.g., CO2)
  - Trigonal Planar: AB3 (e.g., BF3)
  - Tetrahedral: AB4 (e.g., CH4)
  - Trigonal Pyramidal: AB3E (e.g., NH3)
  - Bent: AB2E2 (e.g., H2O)
- Lone pairs affect bond angles and molecular shape.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. HYBRIDIZATION
- Mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals.
- Types:
  - sp: Linear geometry
  - sp2: Trigonal planar
  - sp3: Tetrahedral
  - sp3d: Trigonal bipyramidal
  - sp3d2: Octahedral
- Determines geometry and bonding in molecules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
- Weak forces between molecules affecting physical properties.
- Types:
  - Hydrogen Bonding (strongest type among dipole interactions)
  - Dipole-Dipole Interaction
  - London Dispersion Forces (Van der Waals forces)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Chemical bonding explains the formation, structure, and stability of molecules. 
VSEPR theory and hybridization help predict molecular shapes, which influence chemical and physical properties. 
Understanding bond types and molecular geometry is crucial for predicting reactivity and behavior of substances.
