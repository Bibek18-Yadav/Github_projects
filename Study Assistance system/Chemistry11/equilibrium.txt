CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM – Grade 11 Chemistry (Nepal Curriculum)
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Chemical equilibrium is the state in which the rates of forward and backward reactions are equal, and the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time. 
It is a dynamic process, meaning reactions continue to occur, but no net change is observed.

--------------------------------------------------------------
2. REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE REACTIONS
- Reversible Reaction: Reaction where products can revert back to reactants (e.g., N2 + 3H2 ⇌ 2NH3).
- Irreversible Reaction: Reaction that proceeds to completion and products do not revert (e.g., combustion of methane).

--------------------------------------------------------------
3. DYNAMIC NATURE OF EQUILIBRIUM
- At equilibrium, forward and backward reaction rates are equal.
- Macroscopic properties (concentration, pressure, color) remain constant.
- Equilibrium is dynamic at molecular level, with continuous formation and breaking of products/reactants.

--------------------------------------------------------------
4. LAW OF MASS ACTION
- The rate of reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.
- Equilibrium constant (Kc or Kp):
  - Kc = [products]^n / [reactants]^m (for concentration)
  - Kp = (partial pressures of products)^n / (partial pressures of reactants)^m (for gases)

--------------------------------------------------------------
5. TYPES OF EQUILIBRIUM
- Homogeneous Equilibrium: All reactants and products are in the same phase (e.g., gases or liquids).
- Heterogeneous Equilibrium: Reactants and products are in different phases (e.g., CaCO3(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO2(g)).

--------------------------------------------------------------
6. FACTORS AFFECTING EQUILIBRIUM (LE CHATELIER’S PRINCIPLE)
- **Concentration:** Increasing reactants shifts equilibrium towards products, and vice versa.
- **Pressure:** For gaseous reactions, increasing pressure favors the side with fewer gas molecules.
- **Temperature:** 
  - Exothermic reaction: Increasing temperature shifts equilibrium to reactants.
  - Endothermic reaction: Increasing temperature shifts equilibrium to products.
- **Catalyst:** Speeds up reaching equilibrium but does not shift its position.

--------------------------------------------------------------
7. APPLICATIONS OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM
- Industrial synthesis (e.g., Haber process for NH3, Contact process for H2SO4)
- Controlling reaction yields in chemical industries.
- Understanding biological systems and physiological reactions.

--------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Chemical equilibrium describes a dynamic balance between forward and backward reactions.
Understanding its principles allows prediction and control of chemical reactions, essential in chemistry and industrial processes.
