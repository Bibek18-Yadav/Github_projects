INORGANIC CHEMISTRY – Grade 11 Chemistry (Nepal Curriculum)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Inorganic Chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the study of **elements and their compounds**, except most organic compounds. 
It includes the study of structure, properties, reactions, and uses of metals, non-metals, and their compounds.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS
- **Periodic Table:** Arrangement of elements based on increasing atomic number and recurring properties.
- **Groups:** Vertical columns; elements have similar chemical properties (e.g., Alkali metals, Halogens).
- **Periods:** Horizontal rows; show gradual change in properties.
- **Classification by Properties:** Metals, Non-metals, Metalloids.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. CHEMICAL BONDING
- **Ionic Bonding:** Transfer of electrons between metals and non-metals (e.g., NaCl).
- **Covalent Bonding:** Sharing of electrons between non-metals (e.g., H2O, CO2).
- **Metallic Bonding:** Delocalized electrons in metals, giving conductivity and malleability.
- **Coordinate (Dative) Bonding:** One atom donates both electrons in a bond (e.g., NH4+).

------------------------------------------------------------
4. STATES OF MATTER AND STRUCTURE
- **Atomic Structure:** Electrons, protons, neutrons; electron configuration.
- **Ionic Compounds:** Form lattice structures; high melting and boiling points.
- **Covalent Compounds:** Molecular structures; low melting and boiling points.
- **Metallic Structure:** Sea of delocalized electrons.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. REACTIVITY OF ELEMENTS
- **Alkali Metals:** Highly reactive; react with water to form hydroxides.
- **Alkaline Earth Metals:** Less reactive than alkali metals.
- **Halogens:** Reactive non-metals; react with metals to form salts.
- **Noble Gases:** Chemically inert; very low reactivity.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. ACIDS, BASES, AND SALTS
- **Acids:** Proton donors (Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry definitions).
- **Bases:** Proton acceptors or OH⁻ donors.
- **Neutralization:** Acid + Base → Salt + Water
- **pH Concept:** Measure of acidity or alkalinity of a solution.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. OXIDATION AND REDUCTION
- **Oxidation:** Loss of electrons.
- **Reduction:** Gain of electrons.
- **Oxidation Number:** Helps identify redox reactions.
- **Redox Reactions:** Simultaneous occurrence of oxidation and reduction.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. METALLURGY
- **Extraction of Metals:** Process of obtaining metals from ores.
- **Reduction Methods:** Electrolytic and chemical reduction.
- **Refining:** Purification of metals (e.g., electrorefining of copper).

------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Inorganic Chemistry provides the foundation to understand **chemical behavior of elements**, their compounds, and industrial applications. 
It helps in explaining **bonding, reactivity, and the preparation of substances** used in everyday life and scientific research.
