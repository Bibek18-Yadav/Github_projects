 STATES OF MATTER
- **Introduction:** Matter exists mainly in three states – Solid, Liquid, Gas; can also exist in Plasma.
- **Characteristics of States:**
  - **Solid:** Definite shape and volume, particles closely packed, strong intermolecular forces, vibrational motion.
  - **Liquid:** Definite volume, takes shape of container, particles moderately packed, translational and rotational motion.
  - **Gas:** No definite shape or volume, particles far apart, weak forces, free motion.
  - **Plasma:** Ionized gas, conducts electricity, found in stars and lightning.
- **Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT):**
  - Particles in matter are in constant motion.
  - Particle motion explains properties of solids, liquids, and gases.
- **Intermolecular Forces:** Forces between molecules affecting melting, boiling, and vaporization.
  - Van der Waals forces, Hydrogen bonding, Dipole-dipole interaction.
- **Change of States (Phase Transitions):**
  - Melting: Solid → Liquid
  - Freezing: Liquid → Solid
  - Vaporization: Liquid → Gas
    - Evaporation: Surface liquid molecules escape
    - Boiling: Bulk liquid vaporizes at boiling point
  - Condensation: Gas → Liquid
  - Sublimation: Solid ↔ Gas directly
- **Properties Related to States:**
  - Density, Compressibility, Diffusion
  - Gas laws: Boyle’s law, Charles’ law, Avogadro’s law
- **Applications:** Understanding chemical reactions, gas behavior, industrial processes.

  conclusion:
- **States of Matter:** Explains physical behavior of substances; important for thermodynamics and material science.
