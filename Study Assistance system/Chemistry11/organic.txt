ORGANIC CHEMISTRY – Grade 11 Chemistry (Nepal Curriculum)
---------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with carbon-containing compounds. Carbon’s ability to form stable covalent bonds with itself and other elements leads to a vast variety of compounds with different structures and properties. Organic chemistry is fundamental for understanding biological molecules, pharmaceuticals, polymers, and fuels.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
- **Hydrocarbons:** Compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen.
  - Alkanes: Saturated hydrocarbons (single bonds, CnH2n+2)
  - Alkenes: Unsaturated hydrocarbons (double bonds, CnH2n)
  - Alkynes: Unsaturated hydrocarbons (triple bonds, CnH2n-2)
  - Aromatic compounds: Contain benzene ring structures.
- **Functional Groups:** Groups of atoms responsible for chemical behavior.
  - Alcohols (-OH), Aldehydes (-CHO), Ketones (>C=O), Carboxylic acids (-COOH), Amines (-NH2), etc.

---------------------------------------------------------
3. NOMENCLATURE
- Systematic naming based on **IUPAC rules**.
  - Identify parent chain (longest carbon chain)
  - Number the chain to give substituents lowest positions
  - Name substituents and functional groups appropriately
- Examples: Methane, Ethanol, Propanone, Butanoic acid.

---------------------------------------------------------
4. ISOMERISM
- **Structural Isomerism:** Same molecular formula, different structures.
  - Chain isomerism, position isomerism, functional group isomerism.
- **Stereoisomerism:** Same connectivity, different spatial arrangement.
  - Geometrical (cis-trans) isomerism, Optical isomerism (enantiomers).

---------------------------------------------------------
5. HYDROCARBONS
- **Alkanes:** Saturated, undergo substitution reactions (e.g., halogenation).
- **Alkenes:** Unsaturated, undergo addition reactions (e.g., hydrogenation, halogenation).
- **Alkynes:** Unsaturated, triple bond, undergo addition and oxidation reactions.
- **Aromatic Compounds:** Benzene and derivatives, undergo substitution reactions (electrophilic aromatic substitution).

---------------------------------------------------------
6. REACTIONS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
- **Substitution Reactions:** One atom/group replaced by another.
- **Addition Reactions:** Multiple bonds react with reagents to add atoms/groups.
- **Elimination Reactions:** Removal of atoms/groups to form double/triple bonds.
- **Oxidation-Reduction Reactions:** Changing oxidation states (e.g., alcohol → aldehyde → carboxylic acid).

---------------------------------------------------------
7. FUNCTIONAL GROUP CHEMISTRY
- **Alcohols:** -OH group, reactions: oxidation, dehydration, esterification.
- **Aldehydes and Ketones:** C=O group, reactions: nucleophilic addition, oxidation.
- **Carboxylic Acids:** -COOH group, reactions: neutralization, esterification.
- **Amines:** -NH2 group, basic nature, substitution reactions.

---------------------------------------------------------
8. POLYMERS AND MACROMOLECULES
- **Polymers:** High molecular weight compounds formed from monomers.
  - Addition polymers (e.g., polyethylene)
  - Condensation polymers (e.g., nylon)
- **Biomacromolecules:** Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids (basic idea).

---------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Organic chemistry studies the structure, properties, reactions, and preparation of carbon compounds. It is essential for understanding life processes, synthetic materials, and industrial chemicals.
