1. OXIDATION AND REDUCTION (REDOX REACTIONS)
- **Introduction:** Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) reactions involve transfer of electrons between substances.
- **Oxidation:** Loss of electrons or increase in oxidation state.
- **Reduction:** Gain of electrons or decrease in oxidation state.
- **Oxidizing Agent:** Substance that gets reduced and causes oxidation of another.
- **Reducing Agent:** Substance that gets oxidized and causes reduction of another.
- **Oxidation Number (O.N.):** Charge assigned to an atom in a molecule or ion based on electron distribution.
- **Rules to Assign O.N.:**
  - Free element: 0
  - Monoatomic ion: equal to its charge
  - Oxygen: usually -2 (except in peroxides)
  - Hydrogen: +1 (except in metal hydrides)
  - Sum of O.N. in molecule = 0; in polyatomic ion = charge of ion
- **Types of Redox Reactions:**
  - Combination reactions
  - Decomposition reactions
  - Displacement reactions
  - Disproportionation reactions (same element oxidized and reduced)
- **Examples:**
  - Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu
  - 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂

SUMMARY
- **Oxidation-Reduction:** Focuses on electron transfer; essential for electrochemistry and metabolic reactions.
