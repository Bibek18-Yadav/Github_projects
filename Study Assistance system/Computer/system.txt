COMPUTER SYSTEM – Grade 11 Computer Science (Nepal Curriculum)
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
A computer system is an electronic device that processes data and provides output in the form of information. It consists of hardware and software components and follows a sequence of operations to perform tasks efficiently.

---------------------------------------------------------------
2. COMPONENTS OF COMPUTER SYSTEM
- **Hardware:** Physical components of a computer.
  - Input Devices: Keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone.
  - Output Devices: Monitor, printer, speaker.
  - Processing Unit: Central Processing Unit (CPU) – Control Unit (CU) and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
  - Storage Devices: Primary (RAM, ROM), Secondary (Hard Disk, SSD, Optical Discs).
- **Software:** Set of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
  - System Software: Operating system, utility programs.
  - Application Software: Word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers.

---------------------------------------------------------------
3. CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU)
- **Definition:** CPU is the brain of the computer that executes instructions and processes data.
- **Components:**
  - Control Unit (CU): Directs all operations of the computer.
  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
  - Registers: Small, fast storage locations inside the CPU.
- **Functioning:** Fetch → Decode → Execute cycle (Instruction cycle).

---------------------------------------------------------------
4. MEMORY
- **Primary Memory (Volatile):**
  - RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary storage for running programs.
  - ROM (Read-Only Memory): Permanent storage for essential instructions.
- **Secondary Memory (Non-volatile):** Hard Disk, SSD, CD/DVD.
- **Cache Memory:** High-speed memory to reduce CPU waiting time.
- **Virtual Memory:** Extension of RAM using storage space.

---------------------------------------------------------------
5. INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES
- **Input Devices:** Allow user to enter data into the computer (Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone).
- **Output Devices:** Allow computer to communicate results to the user (Monitor, Printer, Speaker).
- **Storage Devices:** Store data permanently or temporarily.

---------------------------------------------------------------
6. SOFTWARE
- **System Software:** Helps manage hardware and provides environment for application software.
  - Operating System: Manages hardware and software resources (Windows, Linux).
  - Utility Programs: Antivirus, File management tools.
- **Application Software:** Programs designed to perform specific tasks for users (MS Office, Web Browser, Graphics Software).

---------------------------------------------------------------
7. TYPES OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS
- **Based on Size and Power:**
  - Supercomputer: Extremely fast and powerful for complex tasks.
  - Mainframe: Large organizations for bulk processing.
  - Minicomputer: Medium-sized, for small to medium tasks.
  - Microcomputer/Personal Computer (PC): Used by individuals.
- **Based on Purpose:**
  - General-purpose: Perform multiple tasks.
  - Special-purpose: Designed for specific tasks.

---------------------------------------------------------------
8. CHARACTERISTICS OF COMPUTER
- Speed: Processes data very quickly.
- Accuracy: Provides precise results.
- Automation: Performs tasks automatically.
- Storage: Stores large amounts of data.
- Versatility: Performs different types of tasks.

---------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
A computer system is a combination of hardware and software working together to process data into meaningful information. Understanding its components and functions is fundamental to learning computer science and designing efficient computer applications.
