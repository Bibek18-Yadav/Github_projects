NEB Grade 11 Algebra — Subtopics & Key Points

The “Algebra” unit includes several subtopics. For each, a few important
concepts or things you should understand / be able to do are listed
below.

1.  Logic and Sets

-   Understand what a statement is (proposition), and how logical
    connectives (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) work.
-   Build and read truth tables.
-   Understand set operations (union, intersection, difference,
    complement), and theorems involving set identities.

2.  Real Numbers

-   Geometric representation of real numbers on the number line.
-   Intervals (open, closed, half-open), their notation.
-   Absolute value and its properties (triangle inequality etc.).
-   Field and order axioms (basic properties of real numbers).

3.  Functions

-   Definition of a function; domain and range.
-   Different types: algebraic (linear, quadratic, cubic),
    transcendental (trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic).
-   Inverse functions (when a function is invertible), composite
    functions.

4.  Curve Sketching

-   Even/odd functions; symmetry about axes or origin.
-   Periodicity of functions.
-   Monotonicity: where function is increasing / decreasing.
-   Sketching: Quadratic, Cubic, and simple rational functions
    (e.g. 1/(ax+b)), trigonometric (a sin(bx), a cos(bx)), exponential
    (eˣ), logarithm (ln x).

5.  Sequence and Series

-   Define sequence; understand arithmetic (A.P.), geometric (G.P.),
    harmonic sequences.
-   Properties: relationships among arithmetic mean (A.M.), geometric
    mean (G.M.), harmonic mean (H.M).
-   Sum of finite series; sum of infinite geometric series (when
    converges).

6.  Matrices and Determinants

-   Matrix transpose, its properties.
-   Minors, cofactors; adjoint of a matrix; inverse of a matrix (when
    exists).
-   Determinant of square matrices; basic properties of determinants
    (e.g. determinant of product, effect of row operations, etc.).

7.  Quadratic Equations

-   Nature of roots (real, repeated, complex) and how discriminant (b² −
    4ac) determines nature.
-   Relation between roots and coefficients: sum of roots, product of
    roots.
-   Formation of quadratic equations given roots; symmetric roots etc.
