Grade 11 Calculus â€“ NEB Syllabus Overview

1. Limits and Continuity
- Limits: The value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain point.
- Continuity: A function is continuous at a point if the limit exists and equals the function's value at that point.
- Key Concepts:
  - Indeterminate forms (e.g., 0/0)
  - Algebraic properties of limits
  - Continuity of functions
  - Types of discontinuities
  - Graphs of discontinuous functions

2. Derivatives
- Definition: The derivative of a function represents its rate of change or slope at any given point.
- Methods:
  - First principle (definition)
  - Standard differentiation formulas
  - Derivatives of algebraic, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions
- Applications:
  - Geometric interpretation (tangent line)
  - Monotonicity (increasing/decreasing functions)
  - Local maxima and minima
  - Concavity and points of inflection
  - Rate of change in real-life problems

3. Antiderivatives (Integration)
- Definition: The antiderivative or integral of a function is the reverse process of differentiation. It represents the accumulation of quantities.
- Techniques:
  - Basic integration formulas
  - Integration by substitution
  - Integration by parts
- Applications:
  - Definite integrals and their interpretation as the area under a curve
  - Area between two curves
