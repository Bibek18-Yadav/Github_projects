Statistics and Probability – Grade 11 Overview

1. Measures of Central Tendency
- Mean: The arithmetic average of a data set.
- Median: The middle value when data is ordered.
- Mode: The most frequently occurring value.

2. Measures of Dispersion
- Range: Difference between the highest and lowest values.
- Variance: Average of the squared differences from the mean.
- Standard Deviation: Square root of the variance, indicating data spread.

3. Skewness
- Positive Skew: Tail on the right side; mean > median.
- Negative Skew: Tail on the left side; mean < median.
- Symmetrical Distribution: Mean = median.

4. Probability
- Basic Probability: Likelihood of an event occurring.
- Addition Rule: For mutually exclusive events: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).
- Multiplication Rule: For independent events: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B).
- Conditional Probability: Probability of an event given another has occurred.
- Bayes' Theorem: Calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

5. Random Variables and Probability Distributions
- Discrete Random Variables: Take specific values (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses).
- Continuous Random Variables: Take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).
- Probability Distribution: Describes the likelihood of each possible value.

6. Sampling and Sampling Distributions
- Population vs. Sample: Population is the entire group; sample is a subset.
- Sampling Methods: Random, stratified, cluster, and systematic sampling.
- Central Limit Theorem: The distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases.

7. Estimation of Parameters
- Point Estimation: Single value estimate of a parameter.
- Interval Estimation: Range of values within which the parameter lies.
- Confidence Intervals: Range of values with a specified probability of containing the parameter.

8. Hypothesis Testing
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): Assumption of no effect or difference.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Contradicts the null hypothesis.
- P-value: Probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming H₀ is true.
- Significance Level (α): Threshold for rejecting H₀.

9. Correlation and Regression
- Correlation: Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
- Regression: Predicts the value of one variable based on another.
- Pearson's Correlation Coefficient: Quantifies the degree of linear relationship.
