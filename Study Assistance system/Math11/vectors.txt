VECTORS - Grade 11 (NEB Syllabus)

1. Triangle / Parallelogram / Polygon laws of vectors
------------------------------------------------------
- Triangle law: If two vectors A and B act such that the tail of B is at the head of A, then the resultant vector is the one from the tail of A to the head of B.
- Parallelogram law: When two vectors A and B start from the same point, they form two sides of a parallelogram; the diagonal from the same point gives the resultant A + B.
- Polygon law: For more than two vectors, you can place them head to tail in sequence; the resultant is the vector from the start of the first to the end of the last.
- Associativity: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
- Commutativity: A + B = B + A

2. Resolution of vectors & Unit vectors
---------------------------------------
- Resolution of a vector: Any vector V in a plane can be broken into components along mutually perpendicular axes (x and y).
  If V makes angle θ with x-axis:
      Vx = V cosθ
      Vy = V sinθ
- Unit vector: A vector of magnitude 1, used to indicate direction.
  Standard unit vectors in Cartesian: i, j, k.
  To get a unit vector in direction of V: u = V / |V|
- Null vector: A vector of zero magnitude (0), direction undefined.
- Equal vectors: Two vectors are equal if they have same magnitude and direction, regardless of initial point.

3. Scalar (dot) and Vector (cross) Products
-------------------------------------------
- Scalar (dot) product:
    A · B = AB cosθ
    Result is a scalar.
    Component form: A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z
    Use: Work = F · d = Fd cosθ
- Vector (cross) product:
    A × B = AB sinθ n̂
    Result is a vector perpendicular to the plane of A and B.
    Magnitude = area of parallelogram formed by A & B.
    Properties: anti-commutative (A × B = -B × A), distributive.
    Component form: determinant using i, j, k.

4. Applications in Physics / Geometry
-------------------------------------
- Adding forces: Use vector addition laws to find resultant of multiple forces.
- Work done: As dot product of force and displacement vectors.
- Moment / torque: Cross product of radius vector and force.
- Vector representation of motion: velocity and displacement in components.
- Angle between vectors: cosθ = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)

5. Vector concepts in Mathematics
---------------------------------
- Collinear vectors: Vectors along same line (one is scalar multiple of other).
- Coplanar / non‑coplanar vectors: Coplanar lie in same plane; non‑coplanar don’t.
- Linear combination: Expressing a vector as a u + b v + ...
- Angle between two vectors: via dot product formula.
- Scalar triple product: A · (B × C) gives volume of parallelepiped formed by three vectors.
