ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM – Grade 11 Physics (Nepal Curriculum)
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Electricity and Magnetism are closely related branches of physics that study electric charges, electric and magnetic fields, and their interactions. 
They form the foundation of electromagnetism — the theory explaining electric current, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic induction.

---------------------------------------------------------------
2. ELECTROSTATICS
- Electric Charge: Property of matter due to which it experiences electric force. Two types – positive and negative.
- Coulomb’s Law: Force between two point charges, 
  F = k(q1q2)/r².
- Electric Field (E): Region around a charge where another charge experiences a force. E = F/q.
- Electric Field Lines: Imaginary lines showing direction of electric field.
- Electric Potential (V): Work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to a point. V = W/q.
- Relation between E and V: E = -dV/dr.
- Equipotential Surfaces: Surfaces having the same potential.
- Electric Dipole: Two equal and opposite charges separated by small distance.
  Dipole Moment (p) = q × 2l.
- Electric Flux: Flow of electric field through a surface.
- Gauss’s Law: Net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to total charge enclosed.
  Φ = q/ε₀.

---------------------------------------------------------------
3. CAPACITANCE
- Capacitor: Device used to store electric charge and energy.
- Capacitance (C): Ratio of charge to potential difference, C = Q/V.
- Unit: Farad (F).
- Types of Capacitors: Parallel plate, spherical, cylindrical.
- Factors Affecting Capacitance:
  (i) Area of plates,
  (ii) Distance between plates,
  (iii) Dielectric medium.
- Combination of Capacitors:
  Series: 1/C = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + ...
  Parallel: C = C₁ + C₂ + ...
- Energy Stored in Capacitor: U = ½CV².

---------------------------------------------------------------
4. CURRENT ELECTRICITY
- Electric Current (I): Rate of flow of charge, I = Q/t.
- Drift Velocity (vd): Average velocity of electrons due to electric field.
- Relation: I = neAvd.
- Ohm’s Law: V = IR.
- Resistance (R): Opposition to flow of current.
  R = ρl/A, where ρ = resistivity.
- Factors Affecting Resistance: Length, area, material, and temperature.
- Combination of Resistors:
  Series: R = R₁ + R₂ + ...
  Parallel: 1/R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ...
- Electric Power: P = VI = I²R = V²/R.
- Electrical Energy: W = Pt = VIt.
- Kirchhoff’s Laws:
  1. Junction Rule: Sum of currents entering = Sum of currents leaving.
  2. Loop Rule: Sum of potential differences in a closed loop = 0.

---------------------------------------------------------------
5. MAGNETISM
- Magnet: Substance that attracts materials like iron, cobalt, nickel.
- Magnetic Field (B): Region where magnetic force is experienced.
- Magnetic Lines of Force: Imaginary lines showing the direction of magnetic field.
- Magnetic Flux: Total number of magnetic field lines through a surface, Φ = B·A.
- Earth’s Magnetism:
  Magnetic axis, geographic axis, declination, and dip.
- Magnetic Dipole: A bar magnet has a north and south pole separated by a distance.
  Magnetic Moment (M) = pole strength × distance between poles.
- Magnetic Field Due to:
  (i) Straight current-carrying conductor: B = μ₀I/2πr.
  (ii) Circular loop: B = μ₀I/2r at center.
  (iii) Solenoid: B = μ₀nI.
- Force on Moving Charge: F = qvB sinθ.
- Force on Current-Carrying Conductor: F = BIL sinθ.
- Torque on Coil: τ = nBIA sinθ.
- Ampere’s Circuital Law: ∮B·dl = μ₀I.

---------------------------------------------------------------
6. MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS
- Diamagnetic: Weakly repelled by magnetic field (e.g., copper, silver).
- Paramagnetic: Weakly attracted (e.g., aluminum, platinum).
- Ferromagnetic: Strongly attracted (e.g., iron, cobalt, nickel).
- Magnetic Permeability (μ): Ability of a material to allow magnetic field through it.
- Magnetic Susceptibility (χ): Degree of magnetization, M = χH.

---------------------------------------------------------------
7. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
- Faraday’s Laws:
  1. Induced emf is produced when magnetic flux changes.
  2. Induced emf ∝ rate of change of magnetic flux.
  emf = -dΦ/dt (negative sign shows Lenz’s Law).
- Lenz’s Law: Direction of induced current opposes the change in flux.
- Eddy Currents: Circulating currents induced in metal sheets.
- Self-Induction: Induced emf in same coil due to change in its own current.
  L = self-inductance, emf = -L(di/dt).
- Mutual Induction: emf induced in a secondary coil due to changing current in primary coil.
  emf = -M(di/dt).
- Energy Stored in Inductor: U = ½LI².

---------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Electricity and Magnetism together explain the behavior of charges and currents in electric and magnetic fields. 
They form the basis for modern technologies like motors, generators, transformers, and communication systems.
