MODERN PHYSICS – Grade 11 Physics (Nepal Curriculum)
----------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Modern Physics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of phenomena occurring at atomic and subatomic levels. 
It extends beyond classical physics to explain concepts such as the structure of atoms, photoelectric effect, wave-particle duality, radioactivity, and nuclear reactions.
It forms the foundation of technologies like semiconductors, lasers, and nuclear energy.

----------------------------------------------------
2. DUAL NATURE OF RADIATION AND MATTER
- Light and particles show both wave and particle properties, known as wave-particle duality.
- Photoelectric Effect:
  - Discovered by Heinrich Hertz and explained by Albert Einstein.
  - When light of sufficient frequency falls on a metal surface, electrons are emitted.
  - Important equations:
    E = hf = hc/λ
    KE_max = hf - Φ
  - Where Φ = work function of metal.
- de Broglie Hypothesis:
  - Every moving particle has an associated wavelength.
  - λ = h / p = h / mv
- Davisson and Germer Experiment:
  - Verified wave nature of electrons through electron diffraction.

----------------------------------------------------
3. ATOMIC STRUCTURE
- Discovery of Electron (J.J. Thomson), Proton (Goldstein), and Neutron (Chadwick).
- Thomson’s Model:
  - Atom as a positive sphere with embedded electrons (“plum pudding model”).
- Rutherford’s Model:
  - Discovered nucleus through alpha particle scattering experiment.
  - Concluded that most of the atom’s mass is concentrated in the nucleus.
  - Failed to explain stability of atom.
- Bohr’s Atomic Model:
  - Electrons revolve in discrete orbits without radiating energy.
  - Energy levels are quantized: En = -13.6 eV / n²
  - Energy emitted or absorbed when electrons jump between orbits: ΔE = hf
- Hydrogen Spectrum:
  - Explained by Bohr’s model using the equation:
    1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)

----------------------------------------------------
4. NUCLEAR PHYSICS
- Nucleus: Central part of atom containing protons and neutrons (nucleons).
- Atomic Number (Z): Number of protons.
- Mass Number (A): Number of protons + neutrons.
- Isotopes: Same Z, different A.
- Isobars: Same A, different Z.
- Isotones: Same number of neutrons.
- Nuclear Forces:
  - Very strong, short-range, attractive forces between nucleons.
- Binding Energy:
  - Energy required to separate nucleus into its nucleons.
  - Binding energy per nucleon indicates nuclear stability.
- Mass Defect: Δm = (Zmp + Nmn) - M(actual)
  - Binding Energy: E = Δm c²

----------------------------------------------------
5. RADIOACTIVITY
- Discovered by Henri Becquerel.
- Spontaneous emission of particles and energy from unstable nuclei.
- Types of Radioactive Decay:
  - Alpha (α): Emission of ⁴₂He nucleus; decreases A by 4 and Z by 2.
  - Beta (β): Emission of electron or positron; changes Z by ±1.
  - Gamma (γ): Emission of high-energy photons; no change in A or Z.
- Radioactive Law:
  - N = N₀ e^(-λt)
  - Activity (A) = λN
  - Half-life (T½) = 0.693 / λ
- Uses: Carbon dating, medical treatment, power generation.

----------------------------------------------------
6. NUCLEAR ENERGY AND REACTIONS
- Nuclear Fission:
  - Splitting of a heavy nucleus (e.g., U-235) into smaller nuclei releasing large energy.
  - Used in nuclear reactors and atomic bombs.
- Nuclear Fusion:
  - Combining of two light nuclei to form a heavier one with release of energy.
  - Example: ²H + ³H → ⁴He + n + Energy
  - Occurs in the sun and hydrogen bombs.
- Einstein’s Mass-Energy Relation:
  - E = mc²
  - Shows equivalence between mass and energy.

----------------------------------------------------
7. X-RAYS
- Discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen.
- Produced when high-speed electrons strike a metal target (anticathode) in X-ray tube.
- Types:
  - Continuous (Bremsstrahlung) X-rays.
  - Characteristic X-rays.
- Properties:
  - Highly penetrating, affect photographic plates, ionize gases, and produce fluorescence.
- Uses:
  - Medical imaging, crystallography, and security scanning.

----------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Modern Physics explains the microscopic world that classical physics cannot describe. 
It introduces quantum theory, atomic and nuclear structures, and energy conversion principles.
The concepts of Modern Physics have revolutionized technology — from semiconductors and lasers to nuclear reactors and quantum computing.
