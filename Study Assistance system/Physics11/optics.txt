WAVE AND OPTICS – Grade 11 Physics (Nepal Curriculum)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION
Wave and Optics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of waves, their properties, and the behavior of light. 
It explains phenomena like reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, and polarization. 
This topic helps us understand how sound and light travel and interact with different media.

-----------------------------------------------------
2. WAVE MOTION
- Definition: A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one point to another without the transfer of matter.
- Types of Waves:
  (a) Mechanical Waves – require a medium (e.g., sound waves).
  (b) Electromagnetic Waves – do not require a medium (e.g., light waves).
  (c) Transverse Waves – particles vibrate perpendicular to direction of propagation.
  (d) Longitudinal Waves – particles vibrate parallel to direction of propagation.
- Characteristics of Waves:
  Wavelength (λ), Frequency (f), Amplitude (A), Time Period (T), Wave Velocity (v = fλ).
- Equation of a Progressive Wave: y = A sin(ωt ± kx)

-----------------------------------------------------
3. SOUND WAVES
- Nature: Longitudinal mechanical waves produced by vibrating bodies.
- Speed of Sound: Depends on temperature, density, and elasticity of medium.
  v = √(B/ρ)
- Intensity and Loudness: Related to energy of wave; loudness ∝ amplitude².
- Pitch and Quality: Depend on frequency and waveform respectively.
- Reflection of Sound: Leads to Echo and Reverberation.
- Resonance: Large amplitude vibration when frequency of external force matches natural frequency.

-----------------------------------------------------
4. SUPERPOSITION AND INTERFERENCE OF WAVES
- Principle of Superposition: When two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of individual displacements.
- Interference: The phenomenon of redistribution of energy due to superposition of waves.
  (a) Constructive Interference: Waves add up (crest + crest).
  (b) Destructive Interference: Waves cancel (crest + trough).
- Conditions for Sustained Interference:
  (i) Waves must be coherent (same frequency and constant phase difference).
  (ii) Waves should have same amplitude.
  (iii) Waves should travel in the same region.

-----------------------------------------------------
5. STATIONARY WAVES
- Definition: Formed when two identical waves traveling in opposite directions interfere.
- Characteristics:
  - Nodes (zero displacement points)
  - Antinodes (maximum displacement points)
- Examples: Vibrations in strings and air columns.
- Equation: y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt)
- Applications: Used in musical instruments, resonance tubes, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------
6. LIGHT AS A WAVE (WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT)
- Proposed by Huygens: Light travels as a wavefront.
- Wavefront: Locus of all points vibrating in the same phase.
- Types of Wavefronts: Plane, spherical, and cylindrical.
- Huygens’ Principle:
  Every point on a wavefront acts as a secondary source, and the new wavefront is the tangent to all secondary wavelets.
- Explains reflection and refraction of light successfully.

-----------------------------------------------------
7. REFLECTION AND REFRACTION OF LIGHT
- Reflection: Bouncing back of light from a surface.
  Laws of Reflection:
    (i) Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection.
    (ii) Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane.
- Refraction: Bending of light as it passes from one medium to another.
  Snell’s Law: (sin i)/(sin r) = μ₂/μ₁
- Refractive Index: Ratio of speed of light in vacuum to that in medium.
- Total Internal Reflection: Occurs when light travels from denser to rarer medium and angle of incidence > critical angle.
  Applications: Optical fibers, prisms.

-----------------------------------------------------
8. LENSES AND MIRRORS
- Spherical Mirrors: Concave and Convex.
  Mirror Formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u
- Lenses: Convex (converging) and Concave (diverging).
  Lens Formula: 1/f = 1/v - 1/u
- Power of Lens: P = 1/f (in diopters)
- Combination of Lenses: Effective focal length and power.
- Applications: Optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes.

-----------------------------------------------------
9. INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT (YOUNG’S DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT)
- Demonstrates the wave nature of light.
- Bright and dark fringes formed due to constructive and destructive interference.
- Fringe Width: β = λD/d
  where D = distance between slits and screen, d = distance between slits.
- Conditions for Interference: Coherent light sources required.

-----------------------------------------------------
10. DIFFRACTION AND POLARIZATION
- Diffraction: Bending of light around edges or obstacles.
  - More prominent when size of obstacle ≈ wavelength of light.
- Polarization: Restricting vibration of light to a single plane.
  - Demonstrates transverse nature of light waves.
  - Methods: Reflection, refraction, and polarizing filters.

-----------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
Wave and Optics deals with the behavior and properties of sound and light as waves. 
It explains how waves propagate, interfere, and diffract, and how light interacts with matter. 
Understanding these principles helps in developing modern optical devices, communication systems, and scientific instruments.
