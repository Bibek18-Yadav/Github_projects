                  Flight Safety Weather Predictor

This project helps check whether it is safe to fly based on weather conditions.
It takes in four important weather parameters:

1. Wind speed (knots)
2. Temperature (Â°C)
3. Air pressure (hPa)
4. Visibility (miles)

The program then:
Calculates a safety score for each parameter.
Averages the scores to give a final result:

*Safe to fly
*Fly with caution
*Unsafe to fly

Shows a bar graph using matplotlib so you can visualize how each factor affects flight safety.
You can either:
Enter your own weather data (with an option to get real values from Windy.com)
Or let the program generate random weather conditions for testing.
